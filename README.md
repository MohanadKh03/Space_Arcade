## About the Game  
The spaceship lobby features multiple game machines, NPC attendants, and a central blue screen displaying the leaderboard. Three game machines are currently available:

1. **Brick Breaker**  
   Control the paddle with your mouse to keep the ball in play and clear as many bricks as possible. The ball gradually speeds up over time to ramp up the challenge.

2. **Space Shooter**  
   Aim and click with a mouse-controlled crosshair to shoot incoming enemy ships. You start with 20 HP, which decreases when enemies slip past your defenses.

3. **Space Invader**  
   Pilot your spaceship to fire at advancing alien waves while dodging their return fire. Rack up points by eliminating enemies before they reach your position.
